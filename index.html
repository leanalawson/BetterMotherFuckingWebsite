<h1><p>This is <em>still</em> a motherfucking website.</p></h1>

<p>And it's more fucking perfect than the last guy's.</p>

<h2><p>Seriously, it takes minimal fucking effort to improve this shit.</p></h2>

<strong>7 fucking declarations.</strong>

<p>That's how much CSS it took to turn that <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com">grotesque pile of shit</a> into this easy-to-read masterpiece. It's so fucking simple and it <em>still</em> has all the glory of the original perfect-ass website:</p>

<ul><li>Shit's <em>still</em> lightweight and loads fast</li>
<li> <em>Still</em> fits on all your shitty screens</li>
<li> <em>Still</em> looks the same in all your shitty browsers</li>
<li>The motherfucker's <em>still</em> accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
<li>Shit's <em>still</em> legible and gets your fucking point across</li>

<h2><p>And guess what, motherfucker:</p></h2>

<p>You never knew it, but it's easy to improve readability on your site. Here's how.</p>

<h2><p>Let it breathe</p></h2>

<p>Look at lines 1 and 2 of some shitty website you're building. Assuming they're not married they probably shouldn't be humping. The defaults are trash -- pick a minimum line-height: 1.4 for body copy. Headings should be tighter. If you can't see that...piss off.</p>

<p>If your text hits the side of the browser, fuck off forever. You ever see a book like that? Yes? What a shitty book.</p>

<h2><p>A little less contrast</p></h2>

<p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>

<h2><p>Size Matters</p></h2>

I know your partner says otherwise, but it's true. Bump that body copy to render close to 16px or more. Smaller type works well for print, not the screen.

<h2><p>Line-width, motherfucker</p></h2>

<p>Looking at an LCD screen is strainful enough. Don't make me read a line of text that's 200 fucking characters long. Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.</p>

<h2><p>Yes, this is <em>also</em> fucking satire, you fuck</p></h2>

<p>I love what the creator of <a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">this site's</a> inspiration did. What I'm saying is that it's so, so simple to make sites easier to read. Websites are broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible, but they're also fucking ugly. You and all the other web designers out there need to make them not total shit.</p>
